# snippets
Various of my own code snippets. <br> <br>
Previously I used Github's Gist as my main place to store snippets.<br>
But seeing hard to maintain for the long-run, I've decided to move it all here.

Folders
------
* **algorithm-related** - Snippets related with my involvement with algorithm world previously.
* **old-configurations** - Old configurations I uploaded to gist before, and urrently not using these anymore. [New one would be here](https://github.com/shahril96/dotfiles).
* **random-codes** - Various old snippets such as my code experiments, or simply nonsenses.
* **security-and-RE** - Code snippets made up that're related with CTFs or reverse engineering snippets.
* **useful-codes** - Snippets that still look useful for me nowadays.
